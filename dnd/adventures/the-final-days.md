**Expected Level:** 3

## The Problem

Members of the city guard have joined an evil cult that worships beings from the Plane of Shadow. They have worked tirelessly over the last several weeks to construct a massive summoning circle around the desert city of Amaort. They intend to use the magic in the city’s spire, including the protective ward around the city it generates, as well as the lives of Amarot's citizens to summon the very being they have been worshiping to the Material Plane.

The city is caught unaware and is unable to defend itself. The players have three options.

- Escape the city to a neighboring city and warn them of the evil in advance. This will lead to the fall of their city, but is the safest option for the players. The neighboring cities will survive as a result.
- Trek to the center of Amorot and stop the ritual. This will save the city, but will be the most dangerous option for the players.
- Fail to stop the ritual. This is the fail state of the adventure. The city falls, as well as some of the neighboring cities.

## The City of Amorot Burns

> Rolling sand dunes and arid badlands stretch beyond the horizon, disrupted only by the occasional boulder or towering cactus. At this land’s core, a spattering of cities persist in defiance of the desert’s dryness and heat. The city of Amorot is one of them. Between the natural alleyways forged between towering rockfaces, bustling trade takes place under multi-colored tents or the carved out dwellings that line the walls. All things in Amorot lead towards a central spire of sand-blasted rusted metal - the city’s light source and only ward against creatures of the desert.

Ask the players to introduce themselves and their characters. They players all begin in a shared guild hall when the game begins. Ask what each of their characters are doing.


> The sky darkens and, for a moment, there is silence. Then the screams and clashing of swords begin. The door to the guild hall shatters into splinters and a heavily armored half-elf crashes into the rear wall. Standing in the entrance is an 8 foot tall goliath. Their skin is torn, ashen, and the eyes in their gaunt face are as bottomless pits of empty blackness. The creature’s jaw unhinges from its skull and it bellows a deafening shriek in your direction. Roll initiative.

The undead creature is a **Ghast**. It is hostile towards the party. Upon slaying the Ghast, the sounds of battle continue outside.

A player that succeeds a DC 10 medicine check can discern that the creature is undead and has been a corpse for some time now.

A player that succeeds a DC 10 perception check can discern that it sounds like more of these creatures may be outside. They can also hear distant explosions. 

A DC 18 perception check is able to pick out chanting in infernal, though the actual meaning is unintelligible. A success on this check and a DC 15 arcana or religion check can discern that it sounds like the verbal components of a summoning spell.

If a player leaves the guild hall, read the following:

> The skies have darkened. Where the sun once was, there is now a blood red moon and balls of flame cascade overhead. The street appears empty. The markets are abandoned and broken to pieces. 

If the party looks for survivors, there is a lone survivor is playing dead and amongst the rubble of a broken market stand. If they are questioned, the party learns the following.

- The change was sudden and fast. There was no warning and the guard was taken by surprise.
- The creature that attacked the market came up out of the ground. Most of the street fled, but there were a few casualties.

If the party attempts to leave without checking on the half-elf, they will hear a muffled voice from the rear of the guild hall. The half-elf is dead. On their person are two daggers, a rapier, 12 silver pieces, a large iron coin engraved with a spiral, and a sending stone.

The coin is indication of cult membership. The spiral is a symbol of the Shadowfell and can be discerned from a DC 12 arcana or history check.

The sending stone’s other end is the city guard chief, Commander Winterbloom. They are dying, having been felled in battle. They’re dying words are: “Make for the spire. Save our people from this madness, from this betrayal. You didn’t ask to be heroes, but…”. The chief dies before he can finish their sentence. In reality, the chief had suspicions of cult activity, but had no definitive proof. They regret not taking action sooner as they bleed out on the street.

The party must now make a crucial decision. Do they trust the commander and make for the spire? Or, do they make for an escape from the city. Both destinations are equidistant and 1 mile from the party’s location.

## Navigating the City of Amarot

### Cascading Flame

If the players linger in one spot for too long, roll a d20. On a natural 1, a ball of flame crashes down on the party’s location. Each creature in a 20ft. radius must make a DC 12 dexterity saving throw and take 2d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. Any tiny creatures stowed away are immune to these effects.

### Navigating the City and Random Encounters

Amarot is a labyrinth of alleyways. It will take 3 hours to reach the spire or the outskirts of town. To progress towards the spire, a leading party member must roll a DC 10 survival check. On a failure, add one hour to the total travel time for getting lost.

Each passing hour the spire darkens, enshrouded with an a black aura that intensifies by the second.

Roll on the random encounter table once per hour, until the party reaches the spire.

| ROLL | DESCRIPTION  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 1    | The rock from the left wall has broken and rubble blocks the pathway ahead. Turning back would lose the party an hour’s worth of time. There are also holes large enough for a tiny creature to fit through. The rubble can be carefully cleared with a group DC 13 athletics check. Any creature that can view the rubble from the other side, with a DC 10 perception check, identifies a weak point in the rubble held together by some wood shrapnel that can be pulled away, collapsing the rubble. |
| 2    | The way is blocked and the only way around is through a cliffside dwelling. Traversing the narrow tunnels, you hear an explosion as you approach the exit. The wood bridge connecting to the ground level is broken and there is a 12 foot gap to the other side. The fall is 60 feet to the other side (6d6). |
| 3    | A swarm of hundreds of undead spirits can be spotted in the distance, a sparkling cloak against a dark foreboding sky. They are rushing towards your group and descending with great speed. Have the group make a DC 13 group stealth check. On a failure, a spirit breaks from the swarm and rushes through the rock wall at the player with the lowest stealth roll. They are affected by Horrifying Visage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring. |
| 4    | Mist floods the alleyway ahead, in which you can spot the shadowy figures of two small humanoids wandering and softly weeping. The two figures are two children, Rose and Thorn (Lawful Good), whose parents have been lost in the chaos. The mist functions as an antimagic field. If the group fails their group survival check, they lose 2 hours instead and the next encounter happens in the mist. |
| 5    | 6 skeletons emerge from the ground and assault the party. |
| 6    | 1 cult fanatic is standing on a glowing red infernal rune, draped in a deep scarlet robe, chanting in infernal. They do not notice the party until they are within 30 feet or they have been attacked. Killing the cultist will not stop the spell (there are too many cultists), but they do know how the spell works and what they are attempting to summon |

## The Spire Countdown

After 6 hours, the summoning ritual will be complete. All but a few lucky individuals will be drained of their lifeforce. Each creature in the city must succeed a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or drop to zero hit points.

## Reaching The Spire

> A tower of metal scrap and stone towers overhead, shrouded in a deep aura of blackness. A pair of double doors lay open at its base.

### Climbing the Spire

As the players climb the spire, they will stumble across the the deceased corpse of Commander Winterbloom, the one who issued the quest via sending stone. The commander is heavily bruised with a deep cut across their face. On their person is the second half of the prior found Sending Stone, a rapier, and leather armor.

### At the Spire’s Top

The heart is a **Summoned Shadow Heart**, a partial summoning of an unknowable creature of the shadowfell. It will attempt to use charm person on the first person to enter through the doorway, prior to rolling initiative. There are 3 **Cultists** guarding the heart and are hostile on sight of the party. The cultists and heart will fight to the death. Killing the heart stops the ritual. It will siphon the lifeforce of the cultists throughout the city to power its escape back to the Shadowfell.

## Reaching The Exit Gate

> Nearing the edge of the city, the true nature of the summoning magic can be seen. The city is surrounded in a ring of red light, the city itself being used as a medium for spell’s magic. The only exit ahead, between two walls of red stone is an open archway, blocked by a floating tentacled monstrosity, sporting a single bulging eye.

The creature guarding the exit is a **Spectator**. 2 **Cult Fanatics** are stationed on either tower, one cultist a piece. With the fog, they will not notice the party until the party is within 60 ft. They will instead attempt to make the party turn back before turning hostile. These creatures will not leave their station and will abandon pursuit of the party after a distance of 120 feet of the exit.

## Consequences

### The Ritual is Stopped

> The heart shudders before letting out a deafening shriek, dissipating into a cloud of ash lost on the wind. After a few moments, the clouds too fade and sun bears down on the city of Amarot.
>
> Though the city survives, ¼ of its residents are lost in the calamity. Half of the guard has completely vanished. Of those remaining, most have died. The corpses of the undead that roamed the streets just days prior have vanished as well.
>
> Rumors of your exploits have spread like wildfire, with just as many untrue rumors as there are accurate depictions of the day. You are heralded as heroes, enshrined in Amorots history.I

Ask the players how they spend these last few weeks and what future awaits them.

### The Ritual is Not Stopped

> The air is sucked inwards towards the spire, torn from your lungs. You watch in horror as streams of dark energy arc upwards towards the spire’s peak and crash into the heart. The dark aura shrouding it grows and forms a colossal being of pure void. And that is the last that you see before your souls join the countless others that fuel the shadowy horror.
>
> Amarot does not survive. A few lucky refugees forge settlements in the desert, only to have them shortly overrun by the undead hoard that emanate from the Amarot’s core.
>
> The future of the desertlands is uncertain and the surrounding cities were ill prepared from the onslaught.

### The Players Escape the City

> Days trekking through the sand leads you to the neighboring city of Habarashi, a sprawling metropolis of industry and scholarship, nestled in the core of the Habash desert, like a rust colored oasis of stonemasonry and artifice.
>
> Your word eventually reaches the guard, sounding an early alarm, giving the desert cities time to amass their forces and meet the undead on the field of battle.
>
> The casualties are great, but you have bought the desert crucial time to prepare and seek aid from across the continent.

Ask the players how they spend these last few weeks and what future awaits them.

---

Deep in the slums of the industrial underground a local gang leader discovered the ruins of a temple dedicated to the long deceased destruction goddess by the name of Enkiem. This man wrongfully believes that Enkiem can be resurrected and has been rounding people up in the underground for the purpose of being offered in a blood sacrifice. The occult have taken over the war torn underground and there are fears of their influence bubbling up to the city on the surface. This adventure begins in the desert metropolis of Habarashi City and has players will descending down into the dark recesses of the poverty stricken Pipes district to investigate the disappearances.

**Expected Level:** 5

**Expected Sessions:** Approximately 6 sessions

## How This Adventure Works

This adventure is broken up into three primary sections, though there is no particular order to this module. Be sure to read the adventure in detail. There are many potential branching paths and a ton of room for improvisation. No one path is the correct path. Detailed at the end are two of any number of potential outcomes.

**Part 1. Getting the Mission, Into the Pipes, and Arrival in Cobble:** This section is made up of the first few sections of this adventure. Characters will begin at level 5. The purpose of this section is for the characters to introduce themselves and collect vital information on the adventure’s quest. Though the goal is the same, the main quest is issued between two quest givers; The Habarashi City Guard and the Glimmer family who are located in the village of Cobble.

**Part 2. Arrival in The Cage:** This section has the players exploring the central hub of this adventure and the heart of the conflict. This section is open ended and allows the party to make connections with competing factions. The goal of this section is for the characters to learn of the occult presence and how to reach them.

**Part 3. The Temple of Enkiem and The Prologue:** This section deals with the retrieval of the missing people and the final confrontation between the party and the occult.

> It is possible for players to skip going to Cobble, in favor of traveling directly to the cage. If this happens, they will still likely wish to return by the end of the adventure to return certain NPCs back to their home. The players will have fewer leads on the mystery if they skip Cobble, so expect a session to collect the information they need within the The Cage.

## About Habarashi and the Continent of Runoa

### The Habarashi Empire

The Habarashi Empire spans the central regions of Runoa, encompassing vast sand dunes, subtropical coastal cities, haunted desolate wastelands, and vast mountain ranges at the western reaches of its borders - all connected by the Habarashi Rail. The Habarashi Empire is heavily authoritarian and, while each region maintains their own culture, the Sand Dwarves of the Habarashi City capital city reign with an iron fist.

### Technology in Habarashi City and The Pipes

The world of Runoa, Habarashi included, is one that depends predominantly on artifice and arcane engineering. After a cataclysmic campaign of death and destruction led by the divine, as well as the continent’s over dependence on mages for help, the world shifted their attention towards entrusting the power of the arcane to the masses. Firearms, travel by train, and rudimentary arcane powered appliances are the norm throughout the city. The city itself may be centuries old, but much of the old buildings have been retrofitted to support new connections to a central arcane power grid.

### The State of the Divine

In Runoa it is a commonly held belief that the gods are dead. Over the centuries, the influence of the gods has waned and with it the presence of divine magic. Though it is rare, divine magic still exists, typically channeled through wandering divine spirits created by the long missing pantheon. Because of this, the divine have become a matter of faith rather than explicit knowledge. There are equally as many people that have have forsaken belief in the divine as there are those that adhere to their ancestors’ old traditions.

### Scrip

Scrip is the unofficial currency of The Pipes. It gives off a magical aura that acts as a symbol of its authenticity. Scrip circulates throughout the underground without widespread knowledge of how new Scrip enters the economy. Though there are those who attempt to manufacture their own Scrip, trained experts can spot counterfeits from a mile away. Few understand why, but counterfeiters are quickly assassinated and their bodies turned into public displays for the masses.

In actuality, Scrip is minted aboveground by the Habarashi military and issued to the underground as a means of control, establishing The Pipes as a permanent underclass. The assassinations are carried out by the Habrashi Military.

## Getting the Mission

> A circular red stone wall towers over the desert sands, surrounded with a ring of crumbling ruins that stretch out for miles. A train’s whistle blows in the distance, as a steam engine barrels its way between the vast canyon walls cut deep into the sands and leading towards the city center. Towering sky scrapers of scarlet and ash loom overhead, with a stone monorail track snaking between the buildings. Illusory scenes of all colors cast down into the dust laden air, as vents bellow smog into the crowded streets below. The center of the city is crowned with a cracked spiral tower, topped with a bronze dragon statue. Beneath the streets, a snaking labyrinth of tunnels, sewer systems, and a jungle of metal piping provides shelter for the poor under the glow of neon signs and and from the occasional bout of gunfire.
>
> This is Habarashi City.
>
> You find yourselves navigating a grime encrusted alleyway, kicking up dust in the wake of your footsteps. A door at the end of the alleyway is marked with a bronze plaque, reading “Western Wall Community Defense Minister 7621”.

### The Community Defense Minister’s Office

> A young Dwarvish man in his early twenties greets you into a small brick lobby. He appears preoccupied with his thoughts, stroking his long braided beard before being interrupted. “Minister Braken’s office. May I help you?”, he mutters.

After taking the names of the players, he will open a door behind his desk and gesture for the group to enter.

Tobacco smoke floods the doorway in a haze. The smoke filters out, revealing an plain and orderly office. The lone picture on the wall is a black and white photograph showing himself, and elderly human woman, and four middle aged humans smiling in front of a cave entrance.

**Braken Hallmaker ( Dwarf; He/Him )** is an elderly dwarvish man and the current Community Defense Minister for this area of the Bloodstain District. Braken and his family live in this district. He considers it his solemn duty, as both a father and a public servant, to keep their home safe. As Minister, Braken oversees the reporting of crime and proposes requests for Habarashi Military intervention.

The Habarashi Guard hold an ongoing grudge with Braken. Although he has been effective in keeping his district safe, the guard is rampant with pro dwarvish bigotry. They disapprove of his relationship with his human wife and human step children. Because of this, Braken is often required to work outside of the system to solve problems for his city.

Braken will welcome the players and offer the following information:

- Reports of missing people in “The Cage” have made their way to the surface. The contact comes from the underground village of Cobble, south of the central city; The Cage.
- The reasons for the disappearances are unknown.
- The Cage is a city rife with territorial disputes, where control swings between the hands of gangs every few years. It is a general rule between the gangs that the layperson is never to be touched.
- Gangs in The Cage often have direct influence aboveground, largely through petty theft and new member recruitment. There is a fear that the reports of missing people is a warning of things to come.

Braken wishes for the party to investigate the situation below ground and report back their findings. He will offer 10 gp per person for this information. The underground does not deal in standard currency. Instead, Braken will give each player 3 Scrip to start with. With a DC 13 persuasion check, the payments can be increased to 30 gp per person.

## Into the Pipes

> Four dwarvish guards, each wielding a pair of metal gauntlets, escort you a short walk from the Minister’s office to a 20 ft. diameter manhole cover. Embossed on the surface of the pale green and oxidized metal are the words, “The Pipes”.
>
> Two guards break from your flank and approach a lever. They throw their weight behind it and the metal disk sinks into the street, sliding under the pavement and revealing a ladder descending down into pitch blackness. A pair of flicking lights illuminate the first few feet of the descent.
>
> Upon reaching the ground, you find yourselves in a dark rocky corridor and a stalactite laden ceiling towers a few dozen feed over your heads. All around, a labyrinth of interweaving metal pipework snakes between the walls.

The guards escorting the part are 4 **Habarashi Guards**.

The journey to Cobble will take a couple of hours on foot. Periodically roll on the Random Encounters table further in this module to determine how their journey progresses.

### About the Pipes

#### The Pipes

The Pipes are a district encompassing the sewer system and the abandoned water processing infrastructure of Habarashi City that stretches on for hundreds of miles underground. While much of the equipment used to be vital, developments in technology have left the old equipment too costly to upkeep. These regions of the underground were abandoned by the Habarashi government and taken over by the city’s poor, as living conditions above ground would worsen over the centuries.

The Pipes are not heavily guarded, save for still functioning infrastructure. After centuries of isolation from Habarashi proper, The Pipes have developed into their own “independent” district and developed an economy of their own. Most residents of the Pipes are impoverished and at the mercy of organized crime that rule the underground. Water Insecurity

Being in the desert, Habarashi City has long dealt with the issue of water insecurity. This reality is even more true for the residents of the Pipes. Functioning equipment for processing water is tightly guarded and water is strictly rationed, often acting as a secondary form of currency for the most destitute. In leu of reliable clean water, alcohol and boiled drinks like tea are most common.

#### The Cage

The Cage, is the Pipe’s central hub and a massively dangerous location teeming with gang activity. It is built in the husk of an abandoned water purification plant. Unfortunately for the surrounding villages, travel into The Cage is necessary for day to day business; being home to most sources of water, trade, and night life. To keep order, it is common practice for civilians to be omitted from inter-gang conflicts and territorial disputes.

#### Cobble

Cobble is a small village located on the far outskirts of The Cage and consists of a few ramshackle buildings; an armory, general store, tavern, clinic, and handful of personal homes. Folks predominantly settle in Cobble in search of a quiet life and to escape the chaotic anarchy of the The Cage.

#### Serpent’s Cross

Serpent’s Cross is a dense network of abandoned piping that weaves its way across the northern outskirts of The Cage. This metal jungle is near impossible to navigate without a guide. Hidden among the lattice network of piping are a number of hidden hovels that grant homes to those interested in secrecy or those who aim to prey on travelers.

#### Desert Scorpion Sanctuary

Desert Scorpion Sanctuary makes up the south west outskirts of The Cage. A hoard of gargantuan **Desert Scorpions** have taken over what was once a thriving town. The buildings and ruins of this old town act as a nest for the armored creatures. As scorpion carapace is a key ingredient in a drug called Spike, at great risk to their own lives, many attempt to brave the ruins to hunt.

#### Glailee Genovneer’s Tomb

A collapsed power facility cuts off passage into the far north east reaches of The Cage’s outskirts. Behind these ruins, a deadly and conniving lich bides their time, trapped in rubble. This lich will often attempt to probe the minds of those who pass by her lair, seeking news of the aboveground.

If the players come within 1/2 a mile of this region, have the party roll a DC 13 insight check. On a failure, the lich is able to quietly probe their mind and observe from afar. The inflicted will suffer a slight headache while underground. The lich will wait for opportunities to tempt them with offers in exchange for helping with her release. This effect can only be undone with the use of a Greater Restoration spell or a higher level spell of similar effect.

### Random Encounters

Roll on the random encounter table periodically as the players explore the underground of The Pipes.

| Roll | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | 2 **Desert Scorpion Babies** ambush the party from the shadows, pinning them at the dead end of a narrow tunnel. |
| 2    | 1d6+4 **Ember Bats** line the ceiling, lighting the way with their fiery glow. They will flee upon being disturbed, but not without each making ranged attacks on the party in a surprise round of combat. |
| 3    | A discarded handheld water purifier is spotted in a crevasse along a cavern wall.. While broken, it can sell for 10 Scrip. In working condition, it can sell for 100 Scrip to the right buyer. A DC 16 INT check reveals that a replacement arcane battery adapter ( 10 Scrip ), tinkerer’s tools, and an hour’s worth of time are all that is needed to repair the purifier. |
| 4    | Blue glowing mushrooms sprout the side of a wall. These mushrooms act as a concentrated form of **Glow**, and act for a duration of eight hours. |
| 5    | A fossilized leg bone, stretching four dozen feet long, spans the far edge of a cavern ahead. A DC 13 religion check reveals that these bones once belonged to colossal divine constructs known as Titans. |

## Arrival in Cobble

![Cobble Handout](/assets/img/handouts/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-cobble-handout.png)

**Village Leader Oseanas Adalyth ( High Elf; He/Him )** was born in The Pipes and has never seen the light of day. Having lived in The Pipes for centuries, he has witnessed first hand the savage founding of The Cage. He works tirelessly to keep his town neutral and independent from the gang leaders that rule the region and fears entanglements with them. He will not acknowledge the abductions and reports of missing people are real unless he is forced to. Oseanas knows the following, but will never offer this information freely:

- The abductions are real and being carried out by an upstart occult faction.
- The new faction leader is seen as a revolutionary and wished accelerate Habrashi’s demise.

**Kevaka and Madeline Glimmer ( Human; She/Her, Human; She/Her )** are both residents of Cobble. Their late teenage son **Max Glimmer ( Human; He/Him )** has gone missing as a result of the recent abductions. They were the ones that risked sneaking above ground to garner help from the minister.

Kevaka and Madeline know the following and will offer this information freely:

- Disappearances have been random and with no notice. “People just don’t come home”.
- Max was a budding sword fighter, with dreams to compete in the fighting pits aboveground. He trained at a gym a few miles from home.

Kevaka and Madeline never approved of their son venturing into The Cage. But, fearing they could not stop him, they would rather his travels happen on their terms and with their knowledge. The two blame themselves for their son’s disappearance and are hesitant to admit it.

### The Armory

The Armory is a shed built from scrap metal that contains supplies for the village in times of emergency. Entrance into the shed without Oseanas’s permission is prohibited. The shed contains the following:

- 3 **Muskets**
- 1000 rounds of ammunition
- 4 **Short Swords**
- 100 **Rations**
- 30 One gallon jugs of water

- Spirit: 1 Scrip
- Beer: 4 Scrip
 
### General Store

An old man in his 80s, Damon, runs the general store. He is blind and depends on his black kitten Shookles to fetch him things from around his home. Shookles is beloved by the people of Cobble.

### Guard Dogs

The village leader owns a pack of 6 Guard Dogs that are trained to alert the town when intruders step within the village borders. What is not known to the general public is that these dogs are trained to attack and kill on command.

### Jone's Medical Clinic

Jones’s medical clinic is located within a shoddy scrap built cottage. Jones pitches himself as a doctor for all medical needs, often issuing less than standard medication for illness. He has no training and is 100% self-taught in the craft. His mannerisms are sleazy and he openly prays on the good people of the village.

## Arrival in The Cage

![Cage Handout](/assets/img/handouts/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-the-cage-handout.png)

### Entering The Cage

> The sound of dripping intensifies, echoing throughout the stalactite ridden tunnel. As you turn a corner, the passageway opens to a vast cavern carved from the surrounding rock. A long railway spans the distance towards the center of the chamber, upon which rises an industrial obelisk of pipes, all billowing steam from every seam of their metal plating. Harsh spotlights criss-cross in every direction, sporadically cutting through the steam and basking you in blinding light.
>
> An empty tram car is docked at the far end of the ravine.

A lever can be pulled within the tram car which activates it to move to the opposite side of the ravine. The tram is the only way in and out of The Cage. Doing this also alerts the various gangs of any unplanned entrances or exits from the city.

The players will enter The Cage in Fallen Territory, at the Central Marketplace. As the players explore The Cage roll on the Random Encounters below.

![Pipes Map](/assets/img/maps/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-pipes-map.png)

### Random Encounters

Roll on this table periodically as the players explore The Cage. When an encounter involves a **Pipes Bandit** defer to current region of The Cage or roll a faction randomly using the Factions of the Cage section below as a guide.

| Roll | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | 1 **Pipes Bandit** is being publicly punished by 6 other bandits for speaking heresy of their master, “Josephus Dawes” |
| 2    | 4 **Pipes Bandits** get the jump on you and have pistols pointed down from the rafters. They ask you to empty your pockets and to pay a toll. Characters with a passive perception of at least 13 notice them from afar. |
| 3    | A suspicious figure flags you down from a dark alleyway. He is selling water laced with **Glow**, as well as **Spike**. Consuming the water carries with it all of the effects of **Glow**, but for one minute instead of one hour. Watered down **Glow** can be purchased for 5 Scrip per bottle and **Spike** can be purchased for 10 Scrip per hit. |
| 4    | The party makes a DC 18 perception check. On a success, they find that they are being tailed. The pursuer is surveying the newcomers and reporting back to HQ with what they find out. |
| 5    | A group of orphan children can be seen rolling dice in an alley. They gaunt, starving, and seem to be gambling water rations over dice. |
| 6    | The smell of roasted meat wafts down a a central street as you find yourselves in a busy road-side market. A promoter flags you down, advertising their newly opened night club, “Zephyr” Zephyr is in Fallen territory. |
| 7    | No encounter |
| 8    | No encounter |

### Finding the Missing People

**Max Glimmer** and the other missing people are all located in the Temple of Enkiem, at the far edge of Titan’s Graveyard. There are several people throughout the Cage that can clue the players in on this information. There is no correct way to find this information and you should expect to improv a great deal in this chapter as the players hunt for leads.

- **Axel Narcissa** of Liadon’s Gym
- Any **Pipes Bandit** that is friendly to the party
- **Ghrullar**, the leader of the Dwarven Mercenary Faction

### Factions of The Cage

#### History

Control over The Cage has traditionally swung between two prominent gangs; JAX and The Dwarven Mercenaries. Other smaller operations exist and have wielded control briefly, but that control was always fleeting.

The two factions have established their power by territorial control over vital pieces of equipment across the decommissioned water purification plant. Though both factions have limited capability to operate independently of one another, the demand for fresh water is too great for them to handle alone for very long without combining their resources. They were recently in an agreed upon peace.

After a bloody war between both gangs, the two sides had seen their numbers reduce to a third of what they were prior. In this moment of weakness, a new power has risen to take control. Blindsiding everyone, a relatively unknown group called The Fallen recruited members in secret, waiting from the shadows as the JAX and the Dwarven Mercenaries cannibalized one another.

#### The Cage's Code

Though the primary factions operate without formal law, there is an understanding among them that ruling over corpses would lead to The Cage’s downfall. In the first few decades of The Cage’s existence an agreement was reached to never harm or touch civilians. This code had not been been followed perfectly, but those who violate it are punished violently as examples. The Fallen do not respect this code.

#### JAX

JAX maintain control over the central water pipelines that connect to Habarashi City’s sewage system. Apart from supplying water, JAX deal in weapons, repair, and security. They are the smallest faction in numbers and their territory encompasses the northwest region of The Cage. JAX is named for the acronym JAX-968, the model number of the sewage pipeline being tapped into.

**Ideals:** Do a lot with very little and experiment. The Cage falls without JAX. To keep things afloat, no idea is off the table, no matter how brutal or off the wall it is.

#### The Dwarven Mercenaries

The Dwarven Mercenaries maintain control over the alchemical machinery responsible for water purification and leverage this expertise to also deal drugs called Spike and Glow to the masses. They are the oldest of the central powers, with leaders tracing their lineage to the old Dwarven Mercenary Guilds from the aboveground that rule the city today. The upper echelon of the faction’s leadership believe themselves to be the rightful rulers of the city, as their leader is a descendant of an old line of dwarvish monarchs. Their territory encompasses the southeast region of The Cage.

**Ideals:** Fear and despair are the most effective tools of controlling the masses. Tradition and grace is how we distinguish the rulers from the ruled.

#### The Fallen

The Fallen had no territory prior to their recent conquest. They seized The Cage’s center, pushing JAX and The Dwarven Mercenaries to their outermost reaches of the city. In doing so, they seized enough functioning portions of The Cage to achieve complete self sufficiency. The Fallen’s real goal is recruitment and to revive the religious cult that once worshiped Enkiem, a goddess of destruction and rebirth, and to turn The Cage into a church of the dark goddess. The Fallen do not respect The Cage’s code. Heresy and non-belief in Enkiem or Josephus is punished brutally.

**Ideals:** The world is corrupt and unsalvageable. Enkiem will bring an end to the suffering and lead us to prosperity on the surface.

#### Josephus Dawes

**Josephus Dawes** is the leader of The Fallen and the youngest of the gang leaders at 19 years old. He was an average resident of The Cage, growing up in a particularly violent period of its history. A peaceful young man, he wanted to distance himself from the violence. He instead watched his family get swept up in JAX and Dwarven Mercenary activity and perish over territorial disputes. Left with little to his name and struck with grief, Josephus left The Cage to die in peace. He wandered into Titan’s Graveyard and discovered the Temple of Enkiem. It was there that he became enamored with the texts hidden within and the thought of rebuilding a new world over the corpses of those who slew his family.

Josephus is frail, weak, eccentric, and greasy; yet his reputation is well known across The Cage as that of a brutal tyrant. He is known for his unmatched command over the arcane and a rare grasp of divine magic. Myth of him single handedly slaying units of JAX and Dwarven Mercenary men is commonly whispered from the rafters overhead The Cage. Despite his brutality, Josephus first rose to fame though his rare skills in healing magic – which he used to revitalize dying corners of The Cage long forgotten by the dominating factions of the day.

### Fallen Territory

> Several stories of metal balcony are teeming with street vendors, tents, and musical performers. A cacophony of music and bartering booms in what functions as The Cage’s main street.

Any standard adventuring gear, weapons, equipment, and rations can be purchased here in Scrip.

A DC 12 persuasion check can convince a member of the crowd to point the party in the direction of Liadon’s Gym.

The people of the marketplace are a busy people, not wanting to overstay their visit and risk a run-in with members of The Fallen. The following information can be gleaned from conversing with the townsfolk. Players receive all information on the table below, up to the result of an investigation check.

| Roll  | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0-13  | No information |
| 14-17 | Use of drugs like **Glow** and **Spike** are being cracked down on in The Cage. Possession is a public whipping. |
| 18-19 | The Fallen are considered religious zealots, but the townsfolk believe their time in control will be short. |
| 20    | It is believed that the Fallen’s leader doesn’t actually reside in the city, but in the far reaches of The Cage’s outskirts, in Titan’s Graveyard. |

#### Liadon's Gym

> The sounds of the central market muffle as the doors to the gym close behind you. This dimly lit and dusty room sports a dozen fifteen by fifteen foot stages, each roped off with red cord. Atop the platforms, fighters spar with gloved hands and blunt weapons. Plastered along the walls are faded posters of what appear to be a stonework stadium and advertisements of prior fights. Hanging on the walls are also medals framed in glass shadowboxes.
>
> An elvish man with a long black goatee weaves between the platforms. He bellows into a horn, amplifying the sound of his barking orders and critique of the fighters.

Liadon’s Gym is named for an elvish man by the name of Dennis Liadon, current right hand of Queen Liadon of the Krossan Empire and storied war hero in the defense of Habarashi City centuries prior. His skill with a rapier is well known across Runoa. This gym was named in his honor by the current owner. As a young boy, he lived aboveground during the horrors of the city being sieged by the divine and was saved, personally, by Dennis.

The current owner of the gym is **Axel Narcissa ( High Elf; He/Him )**. He trained the missing **Max Glimmer** in swordplay and saw in him potential enough to fight in the Habarashi Fighting pits above ground. It would have been Max’s only real escape from the poverty of The Pipes. When Max went missing, Axel knew full well the cause was from an abduction by The Fallen and where Max is.

Axel fears the Fallen enough to remain silent on the whereabouts of Max. The horrors of the battle that he lived through as a child were caused directly by the destruction goddess they worship. He will be dismissive of the party’s attempts to pry information from him and order them out of his gym, taking them by force is necessary. He will pretend to have not know anyone by the name of Max.

A DC 15 persuasion check is enough for Axel to name his price for what he knows of Max’s situation. Choose any one of the following routes.

- **Route A:** Axel has horrible memories of the Battle of Habarashi that haunt his dreams. He uses Glow to distract himself from his nightmares. Since The Fallen’s takeover of The Cage, it is near impossible to come by for a reasonable price. He will offer information for 5 vials of Glow.
- **Route B:** The gym lights no longer function well and depend on an older model of power generator that is hard to come by in Fallen Territory. He will offer any information in exchange for replacing the generator.
- **Route C:** It has been a long while since Axel has had any significant challenge in the ring. He will offer to spar in exchange for his assistance.

**Roleplaying Axel Narcissa:** Axel lived through the horrific Battle of Habarashi as well as his city’s descent into authoritarian rule. Though he idolizes the historic fighting pits, he desires to continue living below ground and away from the horrors of his youth. Axel is an emotionally scarred and reserved man. Mentoring new fighters is his only real purpose in life.

#### Zephyr Nightclub

There is always a long line to enter Zephyr Nightclub and the music vibrates through the metal scaffolding of the city for several blocks. On slow nights it is a one hour wait time. A **Bouncer** guards the door and can be bribed with 2 Scrip or persuaded with a DC 14 persuasion check to allow the party inside.

> Blue and pink illusory lights bask the dark venue in dim glow. Spectral androgynous dancers gyrate dozens of feet overhead. The crowd is less of a crowd and more of a sea of bodies, with waves crashing at each beat of the music that permeates through every surface of the venue. A purple illusory marque displaying the night’s drink specials hovers around the bar.

Drinks at the bar can be purchased for at the bar for 4 Scrip a piece. High end cocktails can be purchased for 6 Scrip.

As the party navigates the crowd, have each player roll a DC 13 survival check. Upon failure, the party member is lost in the crowd and absorbed into the sea of dancing people. To escape, they must succeed three consecutive DC 10 athletics or acrobatics checks or be sucked back into the dancers.

A DC 15 investigation check allows the party to find a **Glow** dealer by the name of **Genesis (Halfling; They/Them)**. Genesis is a halfling in their early twenties with red hair that half flows down the side of their face. They are leaning against a wall in the back of the venue and flanked by two half-orc bodyguards ( **Bouncer** ). Genesis sells vials of **Glow** for 20 Scrip per vial, an artificially inflated price due to how rare **Glow** is in Fallen territory now.

### Dwarven Mercenary Territory

#### Shadow Market

The Shadow Market is less of a centralized market and more of a loose network of merchants that haunt the dark recesses of the industrial region of The Cage. They make their homes and shops in hollowed out pipes. Anything and everything can be purchased from this network, but at a significant markup. Prices and stock are left up to the dungeon master to determine.

#### Glow and Spike Production Labs

The production labs double as both residences and production facilities for **Glow** and **Spike**. The folks who live here are masters of their craft, some skilled alchemists who fled underground for a rare opportunity at wealth and status. **Glow** and **Spike** can be purchased directly from these facilities, as well as in bulk.

#### Purification Plant

The purification plant is the most heavily guarded section of The Cage. Dozens of guards are stationed at the entrance, barring entry to a small crowd begging for water rations. The plant is a cluster of metal towers, hardly visible through the smog that emanates from the facility’s exhaust pipes. Scarlet banners displaying a the old sigil of Habarashi, a scale balancing a book and a flame, are visible at every corner.

The plant also acts as a central headquarters for the Dwarven Mercenary faction. Few are allowed entry without a direct invitation. Less are allowed audience with their leader, **Ghrullar Stonebane (Dwarf; He/Him)**, of the ancient Stonebane royal line of Habarashi monarchs. This is largely due to the busy schedule required to keep the purification plant running to produce what little clean water they can for their people.

Ghrullar has direct knowledge of where the missing people are located. He will tell the party of the Temple of Enkiem freely, hoping that they will undertake the dangerous mission of slaying Josephus for him.

### JAX Territory

#### Scrap Yard and Repair

The Scrap Yard and Repair region is a collection of warehouses that remained stocked with most parts and machinery needed to keep The Cage running. Though items are often for sale, this is a rare section of the cage that doesn’t just deal in Scrip and will accept gold. They do often need to purchase rare items from the surface and require the currency to do so. The people of the yard are capable of repairing most equipment and upgrading most weapons, though at a hefty cost.

#### JAX-968 Sewage Pipeline

The sewage pipeline is a section of sewage pipeline that has been excavated from the surrounding rock. It has been tapped into, much like how one taps a tree for sap. Though there are water pipelines that run directly into The Cage, they have all been been decommissioned. The only option remaining is to covertly siphon from existing sewage lines. JAX are careful to not draw too much water, in fear of drawing the attention of Habarashi City. Habarashi City recycles this water and monitors it closely.

#### JAX Weapons Depot

Weapons within this district are highly regulated and all marked. There is a need for the people of the district to protect themselves and be armed, but also accountability is required in the event of an assault on the water pipeline. The vetting process to purchase weapons is invasive and extreme, utilizing magic of a **Zone of Truth** spell to verify the answers of the following questions:

- What is your name?
- Where do you hail from?
- What is your purpose for acquiring weapons?
- Are these weapons for yourself or do you purchase for another?
- Have you ever considered violence against the guards who operate the water pipeline?
- Do you have association with those who would conduct violence against the water pipeline?
- Have you ever engaged in violent combat? Why?

Any suspicious answers to these questions will result in a rejection of weapon sales.

## The Temple of Enkiem

![Titan's Graveyard](/assets/img/handouts/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-titans-graveyard-handout.jpg)


> The distant glow of The Cage’s spotlights fade out of sight and the dark cavern bends and spirals downward. Embedded in the rock are the remains of gargantuan fossilized skeletons. A section of, what could only be a massive femur, stretches diagonally across the open space of the tunnel. Shattered shards of bone litter the floor of the cavern, as it opens up at the end of the spiral tunnel. Poking up from the stone are rows of ribs, broken and cracked into jagged points.
>
> Ahead, a humanoid skull looms over you, stretching to the twenty foot ceilings above. Its jaw is wide open and flooded with shadow. One gaping hole, where a massive eye once rested, gazes down from the center of its face.

### Enkiem, Goddess of Destruction

Enkiem was a goddess of destruction, appointed to destroy civilizations and allow them revive from the ashes. She was slain five hundred years prior to the start of this adventure by a band of heroes in her final campaign of destruction, triggering a domino effect that would lead to the rapid death of the old gods. Her legacy of destruction is still revered and feared hundreds of years after her demise.

#### Enkiem’s Titans

When Enkiem conducted her campaigns of destruction across Runoa, it was done with the assistance of colossal cyclops titans, each crafted by Enkiem’s hand. Their massive frame and excellent vision made them equally as adept at surveillance as they were at mass destruction. The titans were Enkiem’s primary sentries and lens into the ongoing war efforts across the continent. With Enkiem’s demise, these creatures collapsed where they stood. Their flesh rapidly rotted away, leaving behind their colossal bones.

The bones of titans are scattered across Runoa and often act as makeshift fortresses for those that make a living in Runoa’s inland regions. Their bones are stronger than most metals, but are notoriously difficult to work with and craft with.

### The Temple

The Fallen have made their residence within this discovered Temple of Enkiem. It was built within the hollow space of a titan’s skull. There are two levels to this temple. On the top level 15 **commoners** of various races are held captive in a cage of bone. **Max Glimmer** is among them. The eyehole, on the second floor, seems to be blocked by a 20ft radius of magical darkness that also blocks all incoming sound.

![Temple Map Ground Floor](/assets/img/maps/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-temple-map-1.png)

#### The Camp

The four tents to the left house one **Pipe’s Bandit** each. The two tents to the right house one **Enkiem Cultist** each. Patrolling in front of the temple’s entrance are two Pipe’s Bandits. The party must succeed a group DC 12 stealth check when approaching the camp. On a failure the two patrolling bandits notice the party and alert the tent’s occupants of intruders. On a roll of 7 or below the entire camp is made aware of the party’s presence.

Each bandit has on their person; one **dagger**, one **pistol**, and 2 Scrip. Each cultist has on their person; one **dagger**, one **quarterstaff**, and 1 Scrip. A DC 13 investigation check or perception check reveals a key to the top floor’s cage on the body of a cultist.

The barrels and crates throughout the camp contain two months worth of rations, 30 gallons of water, and adventuring gear. With a DC 12 investigation check, a creature may find 20 Scrip hidden discretely at the bottom of a ration crate. The also find a silver amulet that can be sold for 15 gp.

#### The Temple First Floor

The inside of the temple is guarded by a metal warforg-like construct, constructed to resemble a much smaller version of the titans whose bones now litter the cavern floor. It is an **Artificial Titan**. The creature houses within itself the long deceased soul of a dead titan, captured and forced into this metal frame by the cultists. It is hostile and will attack all intruders who enter the temple on sight. It only does so on the orders of **Josephus Dawes** however. If Josephus is slain or forced to command the titan to halt, the titan will become docile and await further orders.

The black marble altar presents a crooked staff made of a black and glass-like material. It is **Enkiem’s Staff**.

#### The Temple Top Floor

![Temple Map Top Floor](/assets/img/maps/last-grasp-of-the-fallen-temple-map-2.png)

15 **Commoners** reside in a cage on the top floor of this temple, joined by **Josephus Dawes**. If there is combat on the lower floors, Joesphus will join the encounter after 3 rounds of combat at initiative 20. He will welcome the group to reflect on what they have seen in the Pipes and join his cause of burning “the system” down to ashes. If the players refuse, he will turn openly hostile.

The cage can be opened with a key found on one of the cultists below. Alternatively it can be opened with a DC 12 thieves tools check. The cage’s lock is brittle and can be broken with a DC 15 Strength check. **Max Glimmer** is among the imprisoned.

Situated where the skull’s eyehole should be is a baseball sized orb that emanates a continuous **Darkness** and **Silence** spell within a 20 ft radius. This effect can be dismissed with the cast of **Dispel Magic**. Doing so breaks the device, rending it useless without spending 1500 gp to have it repaired by a master artificer.

The chests to the right side of this room are both locked and can be opened with a DC 18 thieves’s tools check. The chests are also trapped. Any unsuccessful attempt to pick them delivers a shock to all creatures within a 5ft radius of that chest. All creatures within the radius must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful save. This trap cannot be disarmed without first opening the chest or the use of a **Dispel Magic** spell.

The top chest contains 200 Scrip and a **Two Way Journal**. The journal is used by the cultists to communicate with the leader of The Fallen. Listed within it are instructions for a mass sacrifice to the dark goddess, in hopes of reviving Enkiem and beginning again the destruction of Habarashi. In reality, the ritual is a ploy by a celestial patron attempting to use The Fallen to deliver them more strength by means of divine sacrifice. A DC 18 religion check reveals this to be the case.

**The instructions for the blood sacrifice:**

- Collect 30 unwanted souls
- Be deemed worthy of the staff of the goddess
- With the staff, slay them in her name, where she last drew breath

The bottom chest contains four old tomes that can be sold for 100 gp each. They are written in Celestial. Spending an hour skimming the tomes reveals the following information.


- Enkiem was a goddess of destruction and rebirth. Worshipers believe that the natural course of life is to create and then to stagnate. Death and destruction give way to new experience.
- Enkiem’s once walked these halls to visit those who worshiped her. Most were absorbed into her being with no reason given as to why.
- Those who believe the gods to be dead have no patience. Enkiem had forsaken her followers for centuries before her return. She will return again.
- Enkiem’s worshipers believe the city’s prior destruction to be a success. They may not appreciate the new stewards over Habarashi, but it was a change nonetheless.

## Prologue

After the party has tied up any loose threads with the adventure read one of the following outcomes.

### The Fallen Succeed

> Grey skies stretch over a barren field of cracked earth, the center of which sports a ruined clocktower. The shattered glass of the massive clockface litters the ground around the base, yet hardly noticeable among the bones of decayed corpses that stretch on for miles. In the depths of the tower’s basement we see a wretched, gaunt, and ashen wisp of a woman floating inches above the seat of an amber throne. She grasps a staff that begins to hum and glow. She receives a telepathic message in her head, “It is done, yet she does not rise.”. She responds in kind, “This was a fine start, but the divine do no more than stir for such quaint offerings. It is a fine start.”
> 
> Above the Pipes, in the dust laden streets of Habarashi, Josephus raises a staff to the air and flame rains down from the clouds overhead.

### The Fallen Fail

> In the time since the Fallen’s retreat, the pendulum has resumed its swing for control of The Cage. Though civilians resume their lives safely, there is a quiet understanding that bloodshed will once again return and likely be more brutal than ever. The JAX and Dwarven Mercenaries will not stay idle for long with so much territory up for the taking.
> 
> Life in Cobble has resumed its humble existence far from the chaotic madness of The Cage. While Cobble never truly prospers, they have enough to get by. The Glimmers however are nowhere to be found.
> 
> The stands of Habrashi Stadium erupt in cheers and jeers. A young upstart combatant has entered the ring and dethroned a long running fencing champion. He goes by no name, but instead refers to himself as “The Fallen”.

## Context

**Expected Level:** 5

**Number of Sessions:** 1

This adventure is intended to be played with theater of the mind, with no map.

## Premise

Communication has been lost between the Habarashi Empire and the Zotfar prison, home of the empires most dangerous prisoners. The last cohort of guards sent to investigate the issue have gone missing and have failed to report back. Given the vast distance between the capital city and the prison, nearby contractors were instead hired to investigate and make contact with the missing guards.

To make matters worse, the region has also found itself recently shrouded by a mysterious mist, making the prison's neighboring townsfolk uneasy.

It has been three weeks since any word was heard from Zotfar prison.

## Rolling into Town

> The plush red seats and warm candlelit glow of your quarters, on the Habarashi Rail, contrasts starkly with the gray skies and fog laden hills visible outside through the cabin's frost laden windows. The steam engine has long since left the sprawling deserts that envelop the Empire's capital city behind, in favor of the cold and desolate ruins of the Rolling Wastes.

The players all occupy the same cabin. Have them introduce themselves.

> As the train lumbers on, fog continues to creep closer to the locomotive, obscuring more and more of the horizon from view. In just a matter of minutes, the train is entirely enveloped. After a few short moments though, the train pierces through the fog, granting view to a hobbled collection of rickety wooden shacks and an equally shoddy train station. With a sudden jolt forward, the train comes to a complete stop. 
>
> A voice overhead states in monotone, "Fort Wraiththane, End of the line".
>
> Stepping off of the train, dust whips up around your shoes. The air is chilled, sterile, and your breath escapes your mouths in thin clouds before dissipating with the breeze.

The players have arrived in the town of Fort Wraiththane, a small outpost with the sole purpose of servicing those going to and from the Zotfar prison. The people here know very little of the prison's inner workings, but seem troubled by the fact that nobody has come to visit from the prison in almost a month. 

In the town is a small tavern, inn, supply store, and barracks for the guards. The Axecloak road leads directly to the prison; the only road to and from the village.

Unbeknownst to the townsfolk and the Habarashi Empire, the surrounding region around the prison has been recently transformed into a Domain fo Dread, a pocket of the Plane of Shadow. The only way in and out of the town is by a bi-weekly train route. The fog blocks all outside travel by foot. Once the train leaves, shortly after the players step off of it, the players will be trapped here.

## Arriving at the Prison

> A rectangular fortress of granite, several hundred feet wide stands tall against the hardpan ground beneath your feet. Across the windowless face, etched into the stone is the sigil of the Habarashi Empire, a tower embellished with word "Hnorot" (Honor in Dwarvish) down the spine. There is a single set of double doors on the bottom floor, one of them hanging loosely on a single hinge.
> 
> A guard outposts flanks the left side of the road leading up to the prison.

The prison outpost is no longer manned by the living. Inside, the corpses of two guards lay sprawled on the floor, slashed heavily by claw marks. Two clear bullet holes have been made in the door frame. The bodies have been dead for several weeks. On their person is 15 SP, 10 CP, two Pistols with no ammunition, and a broken Sending Stone.

A DC 13 Nature check can infer that no creatures native to this area could produce scratch marks that deep.

A DC 11 Medicine check can spot two puncture wounds on the neck of the necks of the guards and that the bodies have been drained of blood.

## Dr. Nicolae Stoica

Zotfar Prison fell under attack by **Dr. Nicolae Stoica**. Though once a half-elf, he is now a vampiric monster bound to surrounding area of the prison and unable to leave. He will toy with and slaughter any that enter his domain.

### History

Dr. Nicolae Stoica grew up in the center of the Habarashi Capital City to an elven father and human mother, both some of the empire's wealthiest nobles. As one of the few elven citizens of the empire, and often treated as an outsider by his peers, he took an extreme pride in his heritage. In the back of his mind though, he always knew his father would outlive him, and that he was only a fleeting moment in his father's long life.

Nicolae drove himself to make the most of his short lifespan, excelling in studies of the natural sciences and medicine, becoming a leader in his field of study. This expertise landed him a prestigious role as head physician at Zotfar prison, treating the most dangerous and strange patients in the empire. It was here that his exposure to the truly deranged would lead him to madness.

Nicolae would begin to experiment on his patients, secretly mutilating them as a part of his sick experiments to elongate his own life. He was eventually found out and turned into a prisoner at Zotfar himself, relegated to the deepest reaches of the stone monolith. Not wanting to die alone and in disgrace, Nicolae offered his soul to The Dark Powers. In doing so, he crafted a Domain of Dread around himself and was rendered an undead abomination bound to the prison he so desperately tried to escape. Nicolae has slain all that resided within Zotfar, save for his loyal assistant.

## Entering the Prison

### 1A: Lobby

> The two double doors swing open, casting light in empty hall head. Tile floors are splattered with dried blood and corpses scattered at odd angles. At a welcome desk, the pale drained corpse of a dwarvish man is petrified in terror, still reaching up from his chair for help with a frozen arm.

The corpses seem to be made of unarmed workers within the prison. A DC 12 investigation check can uncover 6 ammunition, 12 SP, and 5 CP.

Investigating the welcome desk with a DC 15 Investigation check reveals a note that a prisoner named Nicolae has been acting up as of late.

The end of the hallway branches off to the right and to the left.

**The Left Branch:** This leads to 1B: Upper Cell Block.

**The Right Branch:** This leads to 1C: Long Hallway.

### 1B: Upper Cell Block

> Of the twelve cells, only one has been forced open. A dwarvish man in rags lay sprawled on the tile floor. His ankles are in shackles and crusted blood pools around the ground. Claw mark slashes rake across his front, his rags torn to shreds. The door lay in ruin, reduced to splinters.

The other cell doors are locked and can be opened with a DC 12 Sleight of Hand Check with Thieve's Tools. The prisoners are long dead.

### 1C: Long Hallway

> To the south, down the hallway, you hear footsteps. Nothing is visible and the way forward is shrouded in darkness.

Continuing along the hallway leads to 1D: Guard Office

### 1D: Guard Office

> The long hallway gives way to an office door, hanging ajar. The room appears to have been abandoned and a single wall mounted light flickers on and off with an irregular rhythm. The tile floor sports a single man sized vent built into the floor.

This guard office has long been abandoned. Inside are 3 Muskets and a box of 20 Ammunition.

Have the players make a DC 13 Perception check. On a success, the will notice fleshy arms grabbing up through the grating of the vent. 2 **Boneless** attack the party.

The hallway bends to the left, continuing on to 1E: The Medical Wing.

### 1E: The Medical Wing

> A glass paneled door separates you from the chamber ahead. Written in blood on the opposite side, reversed from your perspective, is "Turn Back". The "K" trails off out of view.
>
> The sounds of footsteps can be heard inside.

**Grace Mendoza** is a former lab assistant for **Dr. Nicolae Stoica**, now masquerading as a guard. She reveres Nicolae and aims to bring her master any travelers that find their way in the prison to feast on. She will pretend to be a member of the guard that survived and tells the party that the rest of her unit are injured and need medical attention. She claims a dangerous monster lay between them and her unit.

There are two doors in this room. Grace will attempt to dissuade the party from exploring her master's office.

**The door on the far end of the medical wing:** Leads to 1G: Caved in Hallway.

**The door on the near side of the medical wing:** Leads to 1F: Nicolae's Office.

### 1F: Nicolae's Office

On the bookshelves, the following can be found: Manual of Flesh Golems, Tome of Clear Thought, personal writings of Nicolae Stoica and his replacement Dr. Stonebane.

In the desk, the following can be found: Potion of Healing, Alchemist Supplies. 

In the far corner is a locked door leading down to The Basement. This can be unlocked with a DC 12 Sleight of Hand check with Thieve's Tools or with a DC 15 Athletics check.

#### Journal of Nicolae Stoica

- Notes outlining experimentation on inmates, pulling blood, and attempting to induce vampirism in the samples.

> Attempt 5043. This halfling specimen ( 512C ) had been particularly resilient to my regular incisions. But ultimately he perished on the table today. I could hardly hear his screams as I cut into him. I was so distracted with how promising this could be, but alas, the room went silent when he perished.
>
> Attempt 5044. I have acquired a new tiefling woman with promise. Perhaps infernal blood will better handle the mutation.

#### Journal Dr. Stonebane

> Personal Log: Entry 1: I visited my predecessor in his cell today. He looked as dead as the people he butchered. My understanding from his research was that he attempted to implant a mutated form of vampirism in his subjects. I shudder at the thought. I have yet to venture into the basement. I cannot open the way and have requested assistance from the guard.

### 1G: Caved In Hallway

> The hallway ahead is caved in with rubble. Standing with your back to you is a hulking figure stitched together with mismatched limbs.

If Grace is with you, she will attempt to lead the party into this room and close the door behind them. She will lock the door -- openable with a DC 14 Sleight of Hand check with Thieve's Tools. She will also attempt to hold the door closed if it is unlocked and can be pushed aside with a DC 14 Athletics check.

The figure is a **Flesh Golem** and it is hostile towards the party.

### The Basement

> Rows of tables line the room, each one sporting a corpse that has been cut into in some manner. Shelves of glass bottles and medical tooling line the walls. At the far end of the room, atop a throne of butchered flesh, sits an unnaturally tall, gray skinned, bald man with yellow eyes. His spider like fingers are tipped with equally long razor sharp claws. He wears shredded tan prisoners rags, just hardly draping from his skeletal frame. He looks up at you and with a fanged wide smile, "Well, it's nice to meet you."

**Dr. Nicolae Stoica** is present in the room and and has gone weeks without new company. He prefers to converse with his victims before he plans to slaughter them, at least until he is no longer entertained.

## Conclusion

Slaying Nicolae will lift the fog surrounding the region. Further investigation of the prison reveals that all inside it have perished.

## Introduction

This adventure is intended for a group of four players at level seven and to be played over one or two sessions. The story takes place long after the events of Curse of Strahd, in the walled off town of Vallaki.

In the events of the aforementioned module, the vampire lord known as Strahd von Zarovich assaulted the town with a group of vampire spawn in his hunt for Ireena Kolyana, his unwilling bride to be. These events shattered the town's trust in the Burgomaster, Vargas Vallakovich. During his governance, the town had been forced to undergo weekly festivals and mandatory merriment in efforts to keep forces of the dark lord at bay. Having now been faced with the undeniable truth that his efforts were all but useless, Vargas was ousted from power. In the present, a wealthy woman by the name of Fiona Wachter had long since taken the reigns.

In secret, Fiona had been a devout worshiper of Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells. While her followers had been previously forced to operate in secret, she could now use them to keep the town of Vallaki under her control. Her people had taken over the Church of St. Andral, rechristening it under the guise of devil worship.

Our story begins with a local family that had been torn asunder by the seductive allure of power. Dmitrei Luca, the adopted teenage son of Desilav and Velimir Luca, joined the cult of Asmodeus and had been missing for several days. Little does Vallaki know that the cult's activities may unintentionally reduce the entire town to ashes.

## Hook: Letter from Mr.Desilav & Velimir Luca

> We send out this plea with no concern for ourselves, only that our young son, Dmitrei, may still yet see the light, and ultimately seek redemption. The devils that rule Vallaki have seduced our son with the promises of power and an everlasting greatness contained within the depths of the Nine Hells. Though we have long preached the holy words of Lathander within our walls, he has joined ranks with the cult of Asmodeus; having now been missing for four straight days. Please, to any that hear our call, save our son from the darkness and pray that we do not perish before our meeting.
> 
> Mr. Desilav Luca and Mr. Velimir Luca

## Arrival at Vallaki & The Household of Luca

> A permeating bleakness of ashen grey blankets over the two grass laden mountains that funnel into walled city of Vallaki. Treading down dusty dirt roads, you are flanked by auburn shingled roofs and pale white facades, peeling with age. The roads are empty, the air without music, and the windows of houses boarded and sealed shut. In the far distance, the spire of a great church towers over the city, painted scarlet, and topped with a gleaming black obsidian pentagram.

A player may make a DC 12 history check to learn that, generations ago, Vallaki was once a place of weekly festivals and merriment. A player who makes a DC 15 history check also learns that the Burgomaster at the time was obsessed with combatting the dark influence of the vampire lord Strahd with forced positivity. This would ultimately end with a gruesome attack on the city at the hands of Strahd's minions, revealing that his efforts were all but useless. The city is now in the hands of Lady Fiona Wachter.

As the players walk through the town, they will be beaconed into a boarded up row home by none other than Velimir Luca. Once inside, the couple will greet the players and explain to them the problem at hand. Together, they know the following information.

- The two of them had been watching the roads closely for any adventurers that may had received their plea for help.
- Their son, Dmitrei Luca, had been returning home late each night for months. Most recently, he returned covered in blood, still wearing cult robes. This was the first that they had been made aware of his cultish dealings.
- Shortly after an argument over his bloody return, Dmitrei ran off. He had not returned for several days now.
- Open worship of any deity other than Asmodeus will result in public hanging. Desilav and Velimir Luca worship Lathander (God of the dawn and renewal) in private.
- The church at the far end of the city used to serve Lathander. It now has been bastardized to serve Asmodeus.
- Vallaki has never a safe place. Forced servitude to the Burgomaster had been the modus operandi of the town for generations now. Nothing changed.
- Fiona Wachter seems to have been living an unnaturally long life for a human. She should be well over two hundred years old by now and her sons are long dead.
- Strahd von Zarovich is either missing, has left the lands of Barovia, or is dead. None are sure.

If the players seem like they want payment for the job, or need extra convincing, Desilav and Velimir will offer 300 gold pieces for the safe return of their son.

If the players seem lost, the parents suggest to check the church for any information.

## The Church of Nessus

### The Church Ground Floor

![Ground Floor Map](/assets/img/maps/church-of-nessus-map.png)

#### A: The Worship Hall

> Scarlet light paints the cracked stone tiles of the church red, as if stained with blood. Rows of stone pews form a corridor down the center of the hall, leading to a stone altar flanked by two candelabras fashioned from human skulls. A set of double doors lay behind this altar, guarded by stone statues of winged devils.

#### B: The Store Room

A player that rummages through the supplies finds the following.

- 10 sets of cultist robes
- 10 sets of priest robes

Among the crates is also 1 **Imp**. This imp is invisible and will attempt to leave the room and warn the priest of visitors.

#### C: The Study

There is 1 **High Priest of Asmodeus** in this room, sitting at his desk.

In that desk, there is a pouch of 60 gold pieces and a key that opens the cellar door in E: Basement Entrance, as well as the cages in H: Prison Cells. The key can be found among the other rubbish with a DC 10 investigation check. The priest, however, is against the idea of players searching through his things.

The bookshelves all contain various tomes on devil worship, Asmodeus, the Nine Hells, and Strahd.

#### D: The Store Room

A player that rummages through the supplies finds the following.

- 10 sets of cultist robes
- 10 sets of priest robes
- 1 scroll of bane
- 1 scroll of dancing lights
- 1 pouch with 250 silver pieces
- 6 daggers

#### E: Basement Entrance

The cellar door in this room is locked. It may be picked open with a DC 12 DEX check using thieves' tools. The door has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points. Any attempt to attack the door will alert all in the church of the players' presence. The door leads directly to A: Basement Entrance.

#### F & G: Stairs to the Spire

These stairs lead to the top of the church's spire. Up here a player can glimpse a full view of the town of Vallaki.

Any player that succeeds a DC 12 perception and DC 15 religion check notices a small scrawling of a ruin on the floor. It is a symbol of Lathander. This floor tile is loose and reveals a hidden chamber, in which contains a **Sun Blade**. 

The bell overhead hides 1 **Hellwasp**.

#### H: Prison Cells

In this room are three human **commoners**, each in their own metal cage. Each of them have been imprisoned for worshiping any entity other than Asmodeus and appear to be badly beaten, starving, and burned. The locks can be picked with a DC 12 DEX check with thieves' tools or opened with a key that can be found in C: The Study. The cages are trapped, causing any who touch the bars to take 6d8 fire damage.

The prisoners in this room have been hearing talk of a ritual to summon agents of darkness to our plane of existence. A sacrifice was needed, resulting in the fourth prisoner being taken to the church basement.

### The Church Basement

![Basement Map](/assets/img/maps/church-of-nessus-basement-map.png)

#### A: Basement Entrance

> Stale cool air floods your nostrils as you descend the rickety wood leading into the church's basement. Ahead of you is a long narrow corridor dissipating into shadow.

Have the players make a DC 15 perception check. Those that succeed can hear the distant chanting of prayer in Infernal, as well as the sound of sobbing

#### B & C: Tombs

There are four stone sarcophagi in these rooms, magically sealed shut. In the presence of divine magic of a good aligned character, they open, revealing the corpses of former priests of Lathander. Each priest holds a scroll of bless.

#### D: Sacrificial Altar

This room contains an altar, atop of which rests a stone basin filled with blood. Scrawled in infernal along the base are the words, "Pay tribute for power and glory".

A player that adds blood to the basin imposes disadvantage on all attack rolls from fiends for 24 hours. This effect may only take effect on one character until the original effect expires.

#### E, F, & G: Quarters

These rooms are sleeping quarters for the cultists that worship here. They are filthy and reek. Any player that enters these rooms must make a DC 10 CON saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage

#### H; The Ritual Hall

> The flickering of amber flames casts long shadows across the cracked stone tiled floor. The young half elf, Dmitrei Luca, wields a dagger in his left hand, knuckles white, and his hands shaking. The blade is being held flush against the prisoner's neck and a narrow trickle of blood runs freely down the victim's neck. The two of them are encircled by fellow cultists and their master, Lady Fiona Wachter. Fiona nods and the blade spills the man's blood. Flames erupt in all corners of the hall and the corpse contorts itself, rising into the air, before becoming engulfed in a void-like sphere of blackness. From that sphere steps a large skeletal figure with insectoid wings and a long serpentine tail of vertebrae, tipped with a sickeningly bulbous stinger.

Proceed to The Ritual Gone Wrong section.

## The Ritual Gone Wrong

This room contains **Lady Fiona Wachter** and 7 **Custists of Asmodeus** encircling Dmitrei Luca and 1 **Bone Devil**. The Bone Devil will gesture to the room, stating that it is here to claim what rightfully belongs to Asmodeus, Fiona's soul. Asmodeus grows tired of Fiona, as she has done nothing to expand her influence outside of the walled off town of Vallaki.

**Roleplaying the Bone Devil:** The Bone Devil will first
attempt to kill Fiona, but aims to kill all in the church.
Roleplaying Fiona: Fiona will do anything and everything
she can to escape the devil's wrath. First and foremost she
will attempt to run.

**Roleplaying Dmitrei:** Dmitrei instantly regrets his
decision and will do anything and everything to simply stay
alive in that moment, hiding when possible.

**Roleplaying the Cultists:** The Cultists are loyal first to
Asmodeus, and join the ranks of the Bone Devil, fighting
against the players, until it is apparent that they are also at risk. At the same time, the cultists will not allow the players to leave alive.

## Returning Home

The result of the encounter outlined above can end in a number of different ways. Attempting to account for all of the potential options is just not feasible and you should use your best judgement proceeding forward. Outlined are just a few ways in which the various NPCs above could react at the completion of the encounter.

### The Priest Survives

The Priest will attempt to go into hiding outside of the city, only to return once it has been deemed safe. If Fiona does not survive, a bounty is placed on his head by the people of Vallaki.

### Fiona Survives

Fiona will do anything in her power to keep you from escaping the church, for knowing too much. If the players do indeed escape, she will spread lies to damage their character and place bounties on their heads.

### The Bone Devil Survives

The Bone Devil proceeds to leave the church and into the town, slaughtering as many within the walls as it can, gifting their souls to the infernal armies of Asmodeus.

### Dmitrei Survives

If Dmitrei survives the encounter, he is in a state of shock and deep regret. He will need medical attention with a DC 10 medicine check to calm him down. If returned to his parents, he shows great shame at the acts that he committed, but will not speak them aloud. His parents will reward you with 300 gold pieces, regardless if it was offered at the beginning or not.

> The sun rises over the vast expanse of the Emerald Sea and the grasslands begin to rustle on a breezeless morning. Hands rise from the green canopy, to the sky, in worship of a new dawn and the warmth to melt their frost laden homes.
>
> Rattles and percussive music flood a labyrinth of tunnels that wind and twist under the soil. Great halls are alive with dance and merriment.
>
> A halfling skiff rides the wind, scouting the horizon for threats. They are pulled down into a burrow and slain without even a chance to scream.

These are the Serpentes, a reptilian people with snake-like lower halves and humanoid upper torsos. They are the original inhabitants of the Emerald Sea and the region of Inis, crafting their underground homes under the cover of the tall grasslands that span the region.

Long separated from the celestial cycles of destruction and rebirth that plagued the west of Runoa, Serpentes culture has been allowed to flourish uninterrupted. Their skill in architecture, agriculture, and healing magic remain unrivaled to this day; Inis being one of the few regions that still officially permit the practice of healing magic. Worship among the Serpentes is diverse, but with a common trend towards favoring the divine associated with heat, warmth, light, and the sun.

Most Serpentes call The Emerald Sea and Inis their home. Since the, very recent, first contact with the west however, many have migrated to the Krossan and Habarashi empires to make new lives from their unique talents.

Serpentes culture is one of independence, with each Serpentes expected to craft their own home and extension of their community's tunnel network. This is a task pursued over the entire lifetime of a Serpentes.

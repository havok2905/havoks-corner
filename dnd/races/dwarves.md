The dwarves of Runoa were the ancestral people of the underground, carving out long lived empires under the sands or within the inner walls of hollowed out mountains. Though originally one people, their cultures predominance towards isolationism caused vast schisms to form between the dwarven people. The migration from the Habash Desert to the western Scarlet Range Mountains split the dwarven people forever in two, each faction adjusting to their new environment respectively.

## Sand Dwarves

The Sand Dwarves draw their lineage to the original dwarven people that carved cities miles beneath the vast Habash Desert. With scarce resources under the sands, their primary focus was on competition with rival clans for dominance. They hunted the scorpions that roamed the tunnels for food, crafting their exoskeleton into intricate weapons and structural material for their homes.

Having spent so much time underground, the Sand Dwarves had lost much of their eyesight over the centuries, depending instead on their superb senses of touch and hearing to get by. Though Sand Dwarves today fashion their homes above ground, their sight remains darkened.

The Valley Dwarves were the first to leave the tunnels under the sands of Habash, venturing west towards the Scarlet Range Mountains. They established tribes along the riverbeds that sliced between the deep red rock, mining the mountains for material for their new cities. With an abundance of materials to work with, these dwarves began to excel at invention and engineering, taking inspiration by the abandoned clockwork machinery deeper in the mines. They would eventually abandon the rivers in favor of living within vast network of mines, returning again to the darkness that their ancestors once thrived in.

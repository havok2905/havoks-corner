## Wind Drift Halfling

![Wind Drift Halfling Example](/assets/img/halflings-winddrift-VLMN5PHT.png)

The Wind Drift Halflings migrated to the eastern planes of Runoa thousands of years before recorded history, separating off from halfling cultures  of the western forest lands fairly early. These people traditionally inhabit the central planes of Inis, where nomadic tribes ride strong wind currents, skating atop the tall grasses of the Emerald Sea. These people have been long adept at reading the stars, both for the purposes of navigation and divination.

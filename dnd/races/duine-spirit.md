![Duine Spirit Example]({{'/assets/img/duine-spirits-example-A3OITYVX.png' | relative_url }})

Once obedient servant constructs of the divine, these immortal spirits now roam the continent of Runoa freely. Though many have chosen to blend in with mortal beings, just as many strive to further the spread of worship of their former masters, unable to accept the death of the gods. Despite their independence, Duine Spirits are driven by an instinctual pull towards the domain of their former masters and pulled towards those that exhibit those values. 

A sense of mortality is particularly strong within the Duine Spirits. Although they are considered immortal, they can still die of unnatural causes. They live their long lives watching their mortal companions perish, always reminded that death comes for all. Because of their long lifespans though, they find issue relating with others not of their kind, save for the most elderly of elves, due to their unnaturally long lifespans.

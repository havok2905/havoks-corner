The Session Zero is a session designed to create alignment between players and plan out the entirety of the campaign to follow. TTRPGs take up a significant amount of a participants time, energy, and frequently delve into sensitive topics. Setting time aside to align on expectations early sets the game up for success. It creates a space to iron out agreements between players and clear up any misunderstandings prior to play.

A long form Session Zero is designed for campaigns between six months and several years long. In longer games, periodically revisiting the checklist below is recommended. This session should take three to four hours.

## Pet Peeves

- List pet peeves as a game master
- Prompt players to bring up their pet peeves to discuss

These should drive discussion of Limits and Veils

## Rules, Lines, and Veils

**Rule:** Procedure around how we engage with the game, mechanics, homebrew adjustments to game system.

**Line:** A hard content limit. This content will never appear in the game.

**Veil:** A soft content limit. This can appear in the game, but as a fade-to-black moment.

**X-Card:** The X-card can be any card or token in a live game. In an online game, players can signal X with their arms or type x into the chat to indicate they are using the X-card, or say “X-Card” out loud. If at any time a player feels uncomfortable with content that is introduced into the game by the GM or by another player, they may use the X-card to veto that content. All other players and the GM must respect what the X-card is for. Once the card is used, the person who used it must indicate what content made them uncomfortable. They do not have to explain why it made them uncomfortable. From there, the content can be changed, faded to black, or a short break can be taken if needed. Under no circumstances should the X-card be ignored when used.

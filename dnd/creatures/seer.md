The Seers are a race of celestial beings that were the original children of the old gods, born from the creators's desire to experience physical form and inhabit the planes. The Seers inherited their ability to tap into the fabric of reality and bend it to their will, but none of old gods's will to help that reality strive and succeed.

Seers typically enact small changes on the planes that spawn effects that carry on through years or even decades. For them, these changes are primarily entertainment, looked upon as a sophisticated form of dance and song. Most Seers are standoffish, wanting to use others to solve their problems for them. When approached directly, they will appear patient, observe the other in great detail, silently creating a mental map of the other.

Above all though, Seers fear the mortal beings of the universe, the second children of the old gods. They view mortal beings as a direct threat to their way of life, with their ability to naturally ascend to lower godhood and attain power that can nullify a Seer's influence. Because of this, they will be moved from inaction to slay all that are deemed candidates for ascension.

Seer society is controlling and manipulative by nature, based around individuals carving out influence over others of their kind. This has manifested in two main factions; those that wish to observe and study from afar, free of influence, and those that wish to shape the universe to their will.

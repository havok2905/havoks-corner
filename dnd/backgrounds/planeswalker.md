> It is not the heat that will get you out here, but rather a lack of discipline and forethought. A crack in the rock is a steam vent waiting to blow, so we go around. Fields of noxious gas and smoke blanket the plateau of volcanic rock before Talon, so we ensure our life support is up to code. The city may be protected from the heat, but our equipment requires constant maintenance. A single pipe weakened by the heat could mean the complete loss of air and cooling to your barracks. The elements do not kill out here. The unprepared kill themselves.

> - Introductions to New Recruits: Manual for Survival on Talon

A team of Montague Mining Company explorers chart a chasm between two tunnels in the Plane of Earth, working to expand the colony of Jord. An adrenaline junky drives a pickaxe into the frozen waterfall of the Plane of Ice that they aim to summit. A grizzled arcane scholar takes samples in the Feywild, escorted by a cohort of elven survivalists.

The Planeswalker is a person who braves the scarcely explored reaches of the elemental planes. With little but what they can carry on their backs, they endure the elements and the chaotic flow of time.

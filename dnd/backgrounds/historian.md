> We take for granted the study of the arcane and its classifications; Conjuration, Necromancy, Evocation, Abjuration, Transmutation, Divination, Enchantment, and Illusion. We see a split between the divine, primal, and arcane sciences. We assume these lines to be immutable facts of the world. But it wasn't always this way.
>
> The ancient Vidarians seemed to have a vastly different outlook on the world. They didn't see such clear distinctions between spell craft and the natural. For example, knowledge of the body was what they leveraged in their healing magics, not prayer.
>
> At some point in our written history, we made a decision to divide our studies and that decision has long infected and warped our understanding of the weave.

> - Professor Aeson Aravaris; On the Taxonomy of Spell Craft

A robed scholar hunches over a pile of scrolls, reading by dim candlelight in the stone catacombs beneath the city streets. An armored commander reflects on past battles and adjusts the pieces on the board set by their generals. A young reporter scribbles furiously into a notebook, taking down every word of their key source's story.

The historian is a wealth of information and a connoisseur of knowledge. It is them who uncover long forgotten secrets, set the narrative upon which society revolves, and leverage the past to change their future. To a historian, the pen and page are tools equally as sharp as the blade.

> The heat of the flames staved off the chill sweeping down from the mountains as I crafted my ammunition for the evening’s hunt. The shadows of Towerfall will know my shot.

> - The Wanderer

The lone wanderer polishes their weapon by a campfire, understanding that it is the only thing between him and undead that wander Towerfall. A young revolutionary raises the rifle to the air alongside their unit, their spirits high following a crucial victory. An elderly gnome tinkers away at a broken revolver, metal gleaming with the flickering flame of the desk lamp.

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Transmuting Touch (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong>
    The Seer uses its Transmuting Touch.
  </p>
  <h3>Lair Actions</h3>
  <p>
    The Seers reside on the little known Plane of Observation, a plane that acts as a nexus between the other planes of existence. It is a cold, barren, and alien place, largely devoid of life. The Seers reside in metal underground bunkers, where they tend to their larvae and observe the other planes from afar. On initiative 20, the Seer takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Seer can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A strong force of gravity manifests at a single point, causing the spell Magnify Gravity to fire at 4th level.
    </li>
    <li>
      Four five foot wide patches of the ground begin to melt and act as quick sand. Each player on a patch must succeed a DC 15 DEX saving throw or be restrained. This can be contested at the end of each player's turn.
    </li>
    <li>
      Four players instantly swap positions with each other. If a play that has no fly speed and cannot hover is swapped with a player that is currently in the air, the new player will fall and take the resulting fall damage.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Regional Effects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The fabric between planes is extraordinarily weak, causing a random elemental plane to partially leak into the Plane of Observation.  
    </li>
    <li>
      The terrain takes on an otherworldly quality. Gravity becomes inconsistent, the ground and air may vary wildly in temperature, light may bend and warp in unnatural ways.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the Seer dies, these effects may fade over the course of 1d10 days.
    </li>
  </ul>
